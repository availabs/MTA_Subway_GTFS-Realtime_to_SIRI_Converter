The PresentableDistance field:
  
  The logic that determines whether stops or miles are shown 
  in the PresentableDistance field is below:
  
      show distance in miles if and only if:
          (distance in miles to _immediate next stop_ is > D) 
          OR 
          (distance in stops to current stop is > N AND distance in miles to current stop > E)

          in other words, show distance in stops if and only if 
              (distance in miles to _immediate next stop_ is <= D) 
              AND 
              (distance in stops to current stop <= N OR distance in miles to current stop <= E)

      Show "approaching" if and only if:
          distance_in_miles to immediate next stop < P

      show "at stop" if and only if:
          distance_in_miles to immediate next stop < T

  Current Parameter Values:
      Parameter	Value    
          D	     0.5 miles
          N	     3 stops
          E	     0.5 miles
          P	     500 feet
          T	     100 feet

TODO: Implement this.

/* ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
   I think this means always 0. Not the N or S bound directions, 
   but a GTFS specific meaning. Always 0 for trains, it seems.

function getBlockRef (getParams) {
    
    From https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#trips_block_id_field
    The block_id field identifies the block to which the trip belongs. 
    A block consists of two or more sequential trips made using the same vehicle, 
    where a passenger can transfer from one trip to the next just by staying in the vehicle. 
    The block_id must be referenced by two or more trips in trips.txt.
